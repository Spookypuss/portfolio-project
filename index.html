                    <p>When learning to build webpages, there is little as exhilarating as hooking into your first API.</p>
                    <p>While the styling on this app wasn't a tour de force, the joy of APIs did overcome me and I was preaching the good word of APIs to everyone
                    I know.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                    And as if my enthusiasm wasn't at fever-pitch already, I learned how to employ a second style sheet to give a dark theme to the app.  This sent
                    me stratispheric in a fervor of coding rapture.  So it might not look like much, but it meant an awful lot to me.

                    <p>There are a few touchpoints problems that virtually all students of the online arts tackle, and like the weather app, the world clock is one of those.  </p>
                    <p>This project was a great experience for me, and I enjoyed trying my hand (for better or worse) at a little 90s styling.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5">My world clock app offers a selection of locations across the globe, as well as making an educated guess at the current time for the end user, when selected.</p>

                    <p>As a keen amateur brewer, I have produced a number of beers in collaboration with my partner.  We initially started with our own brewery names - 
                    Authoritarian Brewery and Anarchy Brewery - and abreviated these to ABAB for our collaborative persuits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As I enjoy making beer labels almost as much as I enjoy developing recipes, and as we have been keen to share the experience with our friends and 
                    family, making a website to document our brews seemed a logical next step.  </p>
                    <p>There we archive our specialty batches such as those to celebrate weddings and births
                    (or even just the sun coming back to the garden after winter).  We also have a gallery of labels to remember the greatest hits from our fermenter.
